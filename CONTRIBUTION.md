## How to contribute to our LearnFitness frontend

### 1. Clone this repo to your local machine and check out the ```dev``` branch
There are 2 branches to this repo. The ```main``` branch is stable and ready for production. The ```dev``` branch is where we develop and test our code. Example git commands:
- ```git clone <url>``` (```git pull``` if you've already cloned it before)
- ```git checkout dev```

### 2. Work on your feature
Once you complete and test your feature, stage the changes and commit it to ```dev``` with detailed commmit messages. It might be a good idea to annouce team members that a new feature is completed, so we can all test it if necessary. 
- ```git add .```
- ```git commit -m <your message>```

Once you're done, the ```dev``` is updated and there should be a warning like below. That

### 3. Make a pull request
Pull request is a way to ensure we do not break our app when multiple people are adding, removing and testing changes. Before the changes are merged into the ```main``` branch, a team member to review the code and resolve conflicts.
